# Bluetooth Control System

## Launching Application

---
Due to security on the Raspberry Pi, the btApp program must be run under the root account. 

` sudo python3 BluetoothControl.py ` will allow for the program to start correctly.

Without providing the sudo command, sockets will not be allowed to open for communication.
